# VS Code Rug Cleaning

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We care about your mental health.

Watching videos of __rugs__ being cleaned can have surprising benefits for mental health. The process of seeing a dirty __rug__ become clean and fresh can be incredibly satisfying and calming

This type of content falls under the category of "oddly satisfying" videos, which have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety levels. The repetitive, predictable nature of these videos can create a sense of safety and predictability, which is soothing to our brains.

In a world that is often chaotic and unpredictable, taking a few moments to watch something go from disorder to order can provide a much-needed mental break. So, next time you're feeling stressed, consider watching a __rug__ cleaning video, it might just help you relax and improve your mood.
